## 🚀 About Me

My name is **Hafiz Muhammad Abdullah Khan**, a 19-year-old self-motivated full stack web developer with a deep passion for coding, cybersecurity, teaching, and the Quran. Born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan 🇵🇰, my journey began not in code—but with the Holy Quran.

By the age of 12, I had memorized the Quran, developing strong discipline, focus, and mental clarity. Later, this foundation evolved into a desire to **solve complex problems** using technology. That’s when I discovered programming.

Currently, I’m pursuing a Diploma in Software Engineering at **Aptech**, while simultaneously contributing to real-world projects, teaching short courses, and continuously improving my skillset. I firmly believe in the power of tech to change lives—and I’m on a mission to become a world-class **ethical hacker and software engineer**.
